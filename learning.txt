I am learning to use git here!!

I also want to know how can I commit some edits.




I want to see how we can add more commits to the same file.

We should move on with the master branch because we should always get updated

I came bact to previous state and from that state I wanted to do some more edits!!

I want to mergeb with the master now!!
